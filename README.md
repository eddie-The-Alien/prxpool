This is prxypool a downloads textfile lists of 
proxys and stores them in a dict to be randomly ran
threw.im useing publicly availble proxy lists so I 
figure picking them at random you would be less 
likely to pull multible burnt ones in a row 
after there burnt they get disgaurded  a new list 
will be downloaded ar resrart or after calling 
prxpool.updtprxlst()
